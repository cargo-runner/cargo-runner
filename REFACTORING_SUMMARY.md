# Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed `runner_v2` to `runners`
- More intuitive naming without version suffix
- Updated all references in:
  - `crates/core/src/lib.rs`
  - `crates/core/src/config/validation.rs`

### 2. Extracted Common Runner Functions
Created `crates/core/src/runners/common.rs` with shared utilities:

#### Functions extracted:
- `get_cargo_package_name()` - Get package name from Cargo.toml
- `resolve_module_paths()` - Resolve module paths for multiple runnables
- `resolve_module_path_single()` - Resolve module path for a single runnable

#### Benefits:
- Eliminated duplicate module resolution code in:
  - `BazelRunner::detect_runnables()`
  - `BazelRunner::get_runnable_at_line()`
  - `CargoRunner::detect_runnables()`
  - `CargoRunner::get_runnable_at_line()`
- Reduced code duplication by ~100 lines
- Centralized module path resolution logic

### 3. Simplified Runner Implementations

#### BazelRunner:
- Before: 40 lines for module resolution in each method
- After: 1 line calling common function

#### CargoRunner:
- Before: Complex inline package detection and resolution
- After: Uses common functions for package detection and module resolution

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **DRY Principle**: Removed duplicate module resolution logic
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to module resolution now only need to be made in one place
3. **Readability**: Runner implementations are now more focused on their specific concerns
4. **Consistency**: All runners now use the same module resolution logic

## Files Modified

1. `/crates/core/src/runners/mod.rs` - Added common module
2. `/crates/core/src/runners/common.rs` - New file with shared utilities
3. `/crates/core/src/runners/bazel_runner.rs` - Simplified to use common functions
4. `/crates/core/src/runners/cargo_runner.rs` - Simplified to use common functions
5. `/crates/core/src/lib.rs` - Renamed runner_v2 to runners
6. `/crates/core/src/config/validation.rs` - Updated imports

## Testing

All changes maintain backward compatibility and existing functionality:
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No functional changes, only refactoring
- ✅ Module resolution logic remains identical
