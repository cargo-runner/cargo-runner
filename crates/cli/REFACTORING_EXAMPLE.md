# Refactoring Example: From Monolithic to Modular

## Before (in main.rs):
```rust
// 2,481 lines of code all in one file
fn parse_filepath_with_line(filepath_arg: &str) -> (String, Option<usize>) {
    // ... implementation ...
}

fn determine_file_type(path: &Path) -> String {
    // ... implementation ...
}

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // ... uses these functions ...
}
```

## After:

### main.rs (simplified):
```rust
mod utils;  // or use lib.rs structure

use anyhow::Result;
use clap::Parser;
use utils::{parse_filepath_with_line, determine_file_type};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // ... now much cleaner, using functions from modules ...
}
```

### Progressive Refactoring Steps:

1. **Start Small**: Extract utility functions first (they have fewer dependencies)
2. **Test Each Step**: Ensure `cargo test` passes after each extraction
3. **Update Imports Gradually**: Use `mod` declarations or update lib.rs
4. **Group Related Functions**: Keep related functionality together

## Benefits Already:
- Reduced main.rs by ~200 lines just by extracting two utility modules
- Each module can be tested independently
- Code is more discoverable (know where to look for parsers vs file utilities)
- Can add more utilities without cluttering main.rs

## Next Steps:
1. Extract display functions (another ~300 lines)
2. Extract config generation (~500 lines)
3. Extract each command implementation (~1,000 lines total)
4. Main.rs becomes just the CLI entry point (~100 lines)

## Testing the Refactored Code:
```bash
# Ensure everything still works
cargo test -p cargo-runner-cli

# Test specific modules
cargo test -p cargo-runner-cli utils::parser::tests

# Run the CLI to verify
cargo run -- analyze src/main.rs
```
